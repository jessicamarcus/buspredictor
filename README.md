#[VERY MUCH IN PROGRESS!]

##(so... maybe I decided to branch off and refactor into Backbone instead...)

###4/24 working snapshot (pre-Backbone): http://jessicamarcus.com/buspredictor/

I moved to a new apartment that puts me equidistant from two MBTA stations (Sullivan and Davis) and serviced by two bus routes (101 and 89). I find myself deciding in some cases to go to one station or the other depending on what bus will arrive soonest, having to switch browser tabs to see which bus that might be. Or I'll be headed to Sullivan, and want to see the next bus headed that way, and I don't care which route - I just want to know when to sprint out my door! Why not take the GPS data NextBus is so kind to share, and display multiple buses on one page to make my life easier?

...and of course, that turned into "I should build this out as an actual application, so it can be useful to people other than myself" - and here we are. I'm a new programmer and this is a work in progress, so don't judge. ;)

###features to be included:
* audible alarm to give 5, 10, 15 minute warnings
* user profiles to store commonly used stops and routes
* visual info design for ease of use with mobile
* phone gps features (stops/buses nearby, etc)

###currently working on:
* data refresh every 60 seconds
* a button to refresh data on demand, for the anxious

###working on next:
* get all stops on a route/all routes/all transit systems
* work out sane ux for selecting stops or routes
