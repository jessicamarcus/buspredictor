============

I moved to a new apartment that puts me equidistant from two MBTA stations (Sullivan and Davis) and serviced by two 
bus routes (101 and 89). I find myself deciding in some cases to go to one station or the other depending on what bus 
will arrive soonest, having to switch browser tabs to see which bus that might be. Why not take the GPS data NextBus
is so kind to share, and display multiple buses on one page to make my life easier?
